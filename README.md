You have become crazy after participating in Ludum Dare year after year.
Finally, at the 48th event, you have to fight your own fears and go deeper in the history of all past LD events.

Play through this content-packed **rogue like**: Fight your inner demons in various different caves, collect items and solve puzzles.

## Controls

The game can also be played well with a controller!

* Move using `WASD` / your joystick + `A` to jump. You can pass through platforms by holding down, and can also climb up ledges by pressing jump again.
* Open the minimap using `Tab` / `LB`. When standing in a room with a path down, the minimap will show a red line to the next level this path leaves to.
* Attack enemies using `SPACE` / `X`.
* Quit with `Alt+F4` ;)
